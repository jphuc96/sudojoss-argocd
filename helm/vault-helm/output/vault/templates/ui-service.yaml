# Source: vault/templates/ui-service.yaml

# Headless service for Vault server DNS entries. This service should only
# point to Vault servers. For access to an agent, one should assume that
# the agent is installed locally on the node and the NODE_IP should be used.
# If the node can't run a Vault agent, then this service can be used to
# communicate directly to a server agent.
